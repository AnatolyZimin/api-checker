* api-checker TODOs
** DONE Mavenize
** DONE Move Normalizer code to a lib in WADL tools.
** TODO WADL Normalize, Builder, opt1 in a single path.
*** Need to determine how this gets put together.
    Current Thoughts:
    1. XProc 
    2. XSLTs only
    Regardless of approach lanch is through scala.
** TODO WADL Normalize, Builder, opt1, checker2dot in a single PATH.
   Maybe an optional output?
** TODO Review builder output -- still make sense? Update if needed.
** TODO Schema for checker XML (XSD 1.1 and 1.0)
** TODO Add Translation Tests.
** TODO Checker to scala.
** TODO WADL Change Detector...
